As businesses adopt digital transformation strategies, they are more susceptible to fraud, leading to a heightened demand for advanced fraud detection and prevention solutions. The global EFM market was estimated at approximately <strong>$2.5 billion</strong> in 2022 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>13.5%</strong> from 2024 to 2032, reaching an expected value of around <strong>$8.9 billion</strong> by the end of the forecast period.</p><p> Key factors contributing to this growth include increased regulatory scrutiny, the rise in online transactions, and a growing awareness of reputational risks associated with fraud. As organizations continue to enhance their risk management frameworks, investments in EFM solutions are likely to escalate. The market is also bolstered by the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies, which provide more efficient and accurate fraud detection capabilities.
